●	Developed a tier-based market value classification framework for 226 Liga 1 players using 27 demographic, performance, physiological, and socio-economic features.

●	Implemented ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost) with stratified 5-fold cross-validation to address non-linear patterns and class imbalance.

●	Applied hyperparameter tuning and threshold optimization to improve minority-class detection.

●	Achieved best performance with CatBoost, obtaining 89% Accuracy, 0.85 Macro-F1, and 0.78 F1 (High-tier).

●	Conducted SHAP-based interpretability analysis to identify key valuation drivers, including minutes played, age, and social media exposure.

●	Published as a first-author paper in a peer-reviewed SINTA 3 accredited national journal (December 2025).
